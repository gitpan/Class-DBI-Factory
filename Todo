to do list for Perl extension Class::DBI::Factory.

* proper debugging hooks
  - in 0.73

* proper exception-handling and bailing-out mechanism that respects 
  apache configuration and plays nicely with downstream handlers
  - expected in ~0.8

* more tests for package-handling, configuration, subclassing 

* decent default session mechanism

* better shorter docs

* wiki pages

* move template-processing to Factory and allow more per-request 
  overriding of configuration
