Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::Factory.

0.70  Tue Jan 26 2004
    - first public release, and so heavily rewritten as to bear little relation 
      to any previous version except in the names of the methods, so I shan't bother 
      recording changes except to observe that the package/plugin thing, automatic 
      configuration refresh and POD are all new in this release and therefore less 
      beaten into shape than other parts.

0.71  Thursday Jan 28 2004
    - made the dbh connection method compatible with sybase by allowing the 
      omission of db_name.
    - configuration file can supply a whole DSN if required to get around 
      compatibility issues (sugg. Ed Sabol).

0.72
    - bugfix: template path reversed before use, so that later definitions
      appear earlier in path: allows package templates to override core
      which was the whole point.
    - various dull internal rationalisations
    - bugfix: CDF::Config::package_loaded() now works. stupido.
    - factory now exposes using() method for template decisions based 
      on packages loaded. package/plugin thing generally smartened up 
      behind it.
    
0.73
    - debugging hooks spread throughout the system in a way that's useful
      to subclasses. configuration files now supply a debug_level that
      controls the amount of detail supplied. exception handling still
      poor, though. that's next.
