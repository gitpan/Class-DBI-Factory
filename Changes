Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::Factory.

0.76  Tues 22 June 2004
    - Brought up to date with Class::DBI 0.96 and Ima::DBI 0.33
      Not guaranteed (or likely) to work with later versions.
    - tweaks to documentation and tests

0.752 Mon 21 June 2004
    - bugfix: makefile was specifying Class::DBI 0.92. very bad. removed.
    
0.751 Sat 24 April 2004
    - bugfix: lists with an id tag (aka prefix) now get the proper input values.
    
0.75 Fri 23 April 2004
    - list object now accepts prefix parameter used to mark input/output
      relevant to this list, and allow inclusion of several lists on one page.
    - minor improvements to Factory class, but no interface changes.
    - pager-handling unborked thanks to Bill Moseley
    - demo updated to paginate properly
    
0.742 Fri 5 March 2004
    - bugs introduced by bug fix fixed.

0.741 Fri 5 March 2004
    - pager tests made conditional on presence of Class:DBI::Pager (d'oh).
    
0.74  Weds 3 March 2004
    - tests no longer require Term::Prompt, so as to get out of the
      dilemma of whether to record it as a dependency or not. This means
      the tests don't work in mysql now, but it means the dependencies
      are all that's required to run make test (so we get past CPAN testers)
    - tests skip if DBD::SQLite not present.
    - template processing consolidated in the factory so that it only
      needs to subclassed in one place.
    - more debugging flags in Factory.pm
    - officially works with cdbi 0.95 (I had forgotten to update :)
      should be fine with anything 0.9x, iirc.
    - lots more tests
      
0.73  Tues 2 March 2004
    - debugging hooks spread throughout the system in a way that's useful
      to subclasses. Configuration files now supply a debug_level that
      controls the amount of detail supplied. exception handling still
      poor, though.
    - This version is the first uploaded to CPAN.

0.72
    - bugfix: template path reversed before use, so that later definitions
      appear earlier in path: allows package templates to override core
      which was the whole point.
    - various dull internal rationalisations
    - bugfix: CDF::Config::package_loaded() now works. stupido.
    - factory now exposes using() method for template decisions based 
      on packages loaded. package/plugin thing generally smartened up 
      behind it.
    
0.71  Thursday Jan 28 2004
    - made the dbh connection method compatible with sybase by allowing the 
      omission of db_name.
    - configuration file can supply a whole DSN if required to get around 
      compatibility issues (sugg. Ed Sabol).

0.70  Tue Jan 26 2004
    - first public release, and so heavily rewritten as to bear little relation 
      to any previous version except in the names of the methods, so I shan't bother 
      recording changes except to observe that the package/plugin thing, automatic 
      configuration refresh and POD are all new in this release and therefore less 
      beaten into shape than other parts.
