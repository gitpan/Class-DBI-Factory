Class::DBI::Factory v0.99

The version of CDF::Handler included here is the first to require mod_perl2. To work with mod_perl1 you need v0.86.

See the POD in Class::DBI::Factory.pm and the other modules for proper documentation.

Read cdfdemo/README and the run cdfdemo/install.pl to set up a simple demo application and see how the handlers, factories and data classes fit together.

For mailing list support, have a look at www.spanner.org/cdf. It doesn't exist at the moment but might by the time you read this :)

If anything is unclear, you have any suggestions or you just want to explain how wrong-headed this is, please write to wrross@cpan.org. For proper bugs in Class::DBI::Factory and its helpers, please use http://rt.cpan.org.
