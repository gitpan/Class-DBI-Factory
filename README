Class::DBI::Factory v0.74

In addition to the prerequisites recorded in the makefile, the tests for this module
use DBD::SQLite and will skip if it's not installed.

The enclosed demo application - in ./demo - also requires DBD::SQLite, and its 
installer uses Term::Prompt and File::Ncopy.

Please send comments (about this inconvenience or anything else) to wross@cpan.org.

Hope this is useful.
