Class::DBI::Factory v0.994

There was quite a lot of grumbling about the recent shift to mod_perl 2, so we've shifted back again, helped along by the API chaos that currently afflicts both mod_perl and libapreq. To clarify:

* Class::DBI::Factory itself neither knows nor cares about mod_perl
* Class::DBI::Factory::Handler works with mod_perl 1
* Class::DBI::Factory::Handler2 works with mod_perl 2

But in the short term it is very unlikely that CDFH2 will work cleanly, as the interface to mod_perl has just changed. I hope that future versions of the Handler base class will be able to work cleanly with both versions of mod_perl, but that will take a few weeks. 

See the POD in Class::DBI::Factory and the other modules for proper documentation.

Read cdfdemo/README and the run cdfdemo/install.pl to set up a simple demo application and see how the handlers, factories and data classes fit together.

For mailing list support, have a look at www.spanner.org/cdf. It doesn't exist at the moment but might by the time you read this :)

If anything is unclear, you have any suggestions or you just want to explain how wrong-headed this is, please write to wrross@cpan.org. For proper bugs in Class::DBI::Factory and its helpers, please use http://rt.cpan.org.
