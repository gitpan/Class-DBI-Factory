Class::DBI::Factory v0.7

In addition to the prerequisites recorded in the makefile, the tests for this module
use Term::Prompt and DBD::SQLite. I haven't required those modules since it would be 
a bit silly, but you will need them for the tests to work.

The enclosed demo application - in ./demo - also requires DBD::SQLite, and its 
installer uses Term::Prompt and File::Ncopy too.

Please send comments (about this inconvenience or anything else) to wross@cpan.org.

Hope this is useful.
